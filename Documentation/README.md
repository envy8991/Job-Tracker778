# Project Documentation

This folder hosts feature-level documentation that used to live alongside the
Swift source files. Keeping the markdown outside of the `Job Tracker` app
bundle prevents Xcode from trying to copy multiple `README.md` files into the
same destination while still making the docs easy to browse.
