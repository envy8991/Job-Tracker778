# Jobs

This feature cluster covers job intake and management. It bundles:

- Core job workflows like `ExtraWorkView` and the shared `JobsViewModel`.
- The **Editor** subfolder with creation, detail, import, and image utilities for single jobs.
- The **Supervisor** tools that expose `SupervisorDashboardView` for higher-level oversight.
- The **Sharing** utilities that generate and parse deep links for sending job summaries to teammates.
